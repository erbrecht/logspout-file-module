# logspout-file
A minimalistic adapter for https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout to write to file.
It can be useful if you want to use it in conjunction with tools for collectiong logs (ex. Splunk to generate application metrics).

Implementation is based on instruction in https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/tree/master/custom.


## features
 - it uses a log rotation strategy to save logs: file is renamed when it reaches a custom defined size
 - provided as a small docker container
 
## usage example
```
# start 'logspout-file' instance 
$ docker run -d --name="logspout-file" --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd)/log:/var/log logspout-file:latest file://filename.log?maxfilesize=10240

# start applications you want to collect logs
$ docker run ...
```

If your applications produce log lines you'll see them in mounted volume (in this example '$(pwd)/log').
```
$ la -1 $(pwd)/log
filename.log
filename.log.2017-08-29T11:49:12Z
```

## custum options
You can customize some features using options:

option |  description   | default value
---------|----------------|--------------
maxfilesize | max size of rotated file | 100 Mbyte
maxfilecount | max number of files to retain | 10
